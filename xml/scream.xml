		<para1>Scream 4 saw the main mask for GhostFaceÂ® being the Deluxe version, a Production run of masks were sent to set, also Zombie versions were included and Scarecrow types too, although we dont see the Zombie and Scarecrow it is said they were randomly placed on kids in the barn scene, i have seen Zombie types online with COA's on EBay now and again. All Deluxes had a New Dwarf type hood and shroud, and was more of a solid mask compared to its thinner latex predecessors, The "Walgreens/Reshoot" style mask has a thinner look on the downward shape of the mouth and eye differences, being slightly thinner than the Deluxe, also the back of the chin cuts off more than the Deluxe, giving the Walgreens its distinctive shape letting us identify it more easily. The more normal name for the mask isnt in existence as such with this type, it can only be described as the 'TD' mold, seen previously way before Scream 4 was announced, yet since the movie has come and gone the mask is in more demand among fans.
